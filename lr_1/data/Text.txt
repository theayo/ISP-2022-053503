But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had
made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung herself
forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous murmur that sounded like ‘My Saviour!’
she extended her arms towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent that she
was uttering a prayer.

At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of ‘B-B!... B-B!...’ — over and
over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first ‘B’ and the second-a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow
curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.
For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming
emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of
self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise. Winston's entrails seemed to grow
cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of
‘B-B!... B-B!’ always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise.
To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction.
But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed
him. And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened — if, indeed, it did happen.
